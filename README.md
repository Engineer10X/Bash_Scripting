# Day1
Learning how to make a bash script and printing "Hello World!" in the terminal.
1. Every bash script ends with .sh (extension of bash script)
2. First line of the bas script must be the shebash, means defining that bash shell is in use. By writing the first line as: #!/bin/bash
3. Then using echo command to write the desired string, in this case : "Hello World!"
To make changes in the file and need to open it run: nano Day1.sh

You can use: echo $SHELL command to check which shell in currently iin use.
To run the bash script:- ./Day1.sh

Exclaimer: In some cases, it should ask for permission of execution of bash script. In that case, run this command to give the permission: sudo chmod +x Day.sh


Few commands to learn: ls, chmod, nano, echo, cat, chsh(used to change between shells, eg: zsh, ksh, bash)
